# Adaptive-Winglets
Aerodynamic analysis of adaptive winglets
This project focuses on the design and analysis of adaptive winglets with adjustable angles to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of an aircraft across different phases of flight. Unlike conventional fixed winglets, adaptive winglets can vary their orientation to optimize performance during take-off, climb, cruise, and descent, thereby reducing drag and improving fuel efficiency.
